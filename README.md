## Introduction
DKonsul is a digital health consultation platform designed to connect patients and doctors through an accessible online service. Despite its potential to expand healthcare access in Indonesia, the current user experience reveals several usability gaps that affect user trust and engagement. Our project aims to analyze and redesign DKonsul’s interface based on user centered design principles to create a more transparent, interactive, and reliable teleconsultation experience.

## Mission
Our mission is to improve DKonsul’s usability by enhancing navigation clarity, information transparency, and interactive support. We focus on building user trust through clearer pricing, visible doctor availability, and an interactive assistance system that guides first time users.

## Design Solution
We propose a set of interface improvements, including:

• Interactive “Tanya Kami” Feature: A chatbot or help button that assists users with basic inquiries before starting consultations.

• Enhanced “Faskes” Page: A dynamic directory that includes maps, operational hours, medical services, and booking options.

• Transparent External Redirects: Pop-up confirmation messages before redirecting users to partner platforms like Dharma Dexa.

• Doctor Directory: A categorized list of specialists general, pediatric, dermatology with ratings and schedules.

• Transparent Consultation Pricing: Clear display of estimated fees (e.g., “Rp 49.000 per session”).

• Testimonial Section: User reviews displayed in a carousel format to build credibility and engagement.

## Target Users
Our design targets diverse user groups, including first-time digital users, busy professionals, urban residents, and recurring patients seeking consistent online healthcare experiences.

## Impact
By implementing these solutions, DKonsul can deliver a more seamless, trustworthy, and user friendly telehealth experience, strengthening its role as a reliable digital healthcare platform in Indonesia.
